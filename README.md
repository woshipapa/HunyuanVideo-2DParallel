# HunyuanVideo3DTransformer-with-Sequence-and-Data-Parallelism
This repository provides an implementation of HunyuanVideoTransformer with both single-stream and dual-stream architectures. It incorporates sequence parallelism using Ulysses' method and data parallelism based on a customized framework of accelerate and deepspeed. The implementation supports both pre-training and inference stages.
